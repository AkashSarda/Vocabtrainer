# Vocabtrainer

VocabTrainer is a online vocabulary trainer Web2py web application for training your vocabulary by rote learning.
The app comes with adaptive tests in which the user has to first see and learn the word listing provided, i.e EASY, MEDIUM, DIFFICULT.

Based only on the words listed in the listing the application will  design a adaptive quiz where you have to answer the words corrosponding to the meaning asked. This is very useful for those perparing for GRE, as they have to rote learn a lot of words.

You can run it on your localhost, and add your own words to the list for say future revision, on the links :
/insert_easy
/insert_moderate
/insert_difficult

Install web2py and this application, compile it and upload and then it is ready to run.
